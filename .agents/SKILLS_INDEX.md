## Skill Selection Quick Reference

### By Problem Type

**UI/UX and Interfaces**
- First: `macos-app-engineering`
- Escalate to `accessibility-audit`, `localization`, `menubar`, `debugging-diagnostics`, or `swift-concurrency-expert` when the task is specifically in that specialist scope

**Performance Issues**
- SwiftUI rendering: `macos-app-engineering` for view structure, then `debugging-diagnostics` if root cause is unclear
- Audio capture/processing: `audio-realtime`
- Logging and telemetry quality: `debugging-diagnostics`

**Concurrency and Safety**
- Swift 6.2 compiler errors: `swift-concurrency-expert`

**Code Quality**
- Readability/refactoring: `code-quality`
- Testing/mocks and test code structure: `testing-xctest`
- Delivery workflow, merge gates, verification policy, and Git mechanics: `delivery-workflow`
- Code review: `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`
- Architecture boundaries: `architecture`

**Security**
- Secret management: `keychain-security`

**Data and Storage**
- Persistence design: `data-persistence`
- Migrations: `data-persistence`

**Intelligence and Post-Processing**
- Kernel mode routing, canonical summary, benchmark gates: `intelligence-kernel`

**Debugging and Diagnostics**
- Crashes, flaky tests, unknown root causes, logging, telemetry, redaction, and failure signatures: `debugging-diagnostics`

**Documentation and Localization**
- API docs/DocC: `documentation`
- UI localization and accessible copy: `localization`
- Accessibility audit and keyboard/focus review: `accessibility-audit`

**Platform-Specific (macOS)**
- General macOS UI/app guidance: `macos-app-engineering`
- Menu bar UI: `menubar`



**Project Maintenance**
- Repository standards: `project-standards`
- Read-only improvement planning: `improve`
- Strict maintainability review: `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`
- Reference project registry and clone policy: `benchmarking`

### Engineering Workflow Ownership

- `delivery-workflow`: risk classification, lane selection, lifecycle sequencing, validation strategy, command mapping, branch, commit, PR, and cleanup mechanics
- `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`: review findings, severity framing, semaforo output, and strict structural maintainability analysis

## Skill Dependencies

- `accessibility-audit` → `localization` (copy and keys stay localizable)
- `macos-app-engineering` → `accessibility-audit` / `localization` / `menubar` (specialist escalation only)
- `delivery-workflow` → `testing-xctest` (delivery gates → XCTest specifics)
- `debugging-diagnostics` → subsystem skills (route to the owner once the failing surface is proven)
- `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` → `delivery-workflow` / other skills (review may escalate to lane, validation, or subsystem specialists)
