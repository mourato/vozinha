# Architecture Principles

## Role

Use this skill as the canonical owner for architecture and dependency-boundary guidance in Prisma.

- Own module boundaries, Clean Architecture application, and dependency-injection expectations.
- Keep architectural advice aligned with the current package/module split.
- Delegate platform-specific implementation details to the relevant subsystem owners.

## Scope Boundary

- Use this skill for module ownership, dependency direction, and cross-layer abstractions.
- Use global `macos-app-engineering` for platform UI/app implementation details.
- Use global `code-quality` when the task is readability-oriented rather than architectural.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to design module boundaries, apply Clean Architecture, refactor architecture, or define dependency injection.

## Overview

Project architectural standards ensuring testability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## 1. Patterns & Structure

- **MVVM / Clean Architecture**: Separate presentation logic (ViewModels) from business logic (Services/Repositories) and views (SwiftUI/AppKit).
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Inject dependencies explicitly through initializers. Avoid direct usage of `.shared` singletons within ViewModels to facilitate unit testing.
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)**: Use protocols to define abstractions. Favor composition over class-based inheritance.
- **Reusable Blocks First**: For both logic and UI-supporting abstractions, apply `reuse -> extend -> create` before introducing new types.

## 2. Canonical Module Layout

- SwiftPM target and import names remain `MeetingAssistantCore*`.
- Physical source directories under `Packages/MeetingAssistantCore/Sources/` use short PascalCase names: `Common`, `Domain`, `Infrastructure`, `Data`, `Audio`, `AI`, `UI`, `Core`, `Mocking`, `MockingMacros`.
- Split files should be organized by owning type directory within the current bucket instead of `Type+Concern.swift`.
- Companion filenames must stay unique within the target; prefer explicit owner-prefixed PascalCase basenames when a generic name would collide.
- `MeetingAssistantCoreCommon` — shared logging, config, utilities, resources
- `MeetingAssistantCoreDomain` — entities, contracts, use cases
- `MeetingAssistantCoreInfrastructure` — OS/external adapters (Keychain, networking, providers)
- `MeetingAssistantCoreData` — persistence repositories and storage adapters
- `MeetingAssistantCoreAudio` — capture, buffering, rendering, file-writing pipeline
- `MeetingAssistantCoreAI` — transcription, post-processing, rendering
- `MeetingAssistantCoreUI` — view models, coordinators, SwiftUI/AppKit presentation
- `MeetingAssistantCore` — compatibility export layer for app/tests

Boundary rule: depend inward through protocols, not across feature layers through concrete types.

## 3. Audio Hot-Path Constraints

- Keep real-time callbacks allocation-minimal and free from MainActor hops.
- Prefer `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` in hot paths; avoid `NSLock` in render callbacks.
- Use pre-allocation and fixed-size buffers for producer/consumer bridges.
- Route non-real-time work (file IO, diagnostics, formatting) out of render callbacks.

## 4. Best Practices

- **Lean ViewModels**: Delegate heavy logic (networking, filtering, processing) to dedicated services.
- **Async Flow**: Adopt `async/await` or `Combine` for asynchronous streams instead of nested completion closures.
- **State Management**: Use `@Published` and `@ObservedObject` carefully to ensure predictable UI updates.
- **Extraction over Duplication**: When behavior repeats, extract to a reusable use case/service/helper in the owning module.
- **Architecture Checks**: For cross-module refactors, run `make arch-check` before merge.
