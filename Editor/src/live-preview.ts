/*
 * Live preview: rendered markdown everywhere except the line the caret is on.
 *
 * This is the hardest thing in the product and the thing most likely to make it feel broken. The
 * brief is blunt about it — "reconciling raw source with rendered decorations is where these editors
 * break, usually as cursor instability. If it feels janky the entire premise is gone."
 *
 * The contract, from decision 5: the buffer IS the markdown. Everything here is a view-only
 * decoration. Nothing in this file may change a single byte of the document, which is what lets Pane
 * promise a byte-for-byte round trip.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS ON THE ACTIVE LINE. Inline constructs go fully raw — the markers reappear and the
 * inline styling drops, matching the one example the design draws ("the raw syntax stays visible on
 * the active line: **byte-for-byte**"). Block constructs — heading size, code block background,
 * blockquote bar — keep their styling and merely reveal their markers. That split is deliberate:
 * bold and italic do not change line height, so revealing them costs nothing, whereas dropping an
 * h1 to body size as the caret enters it would reflow the document under the user's hands. That is
 * exactly the instability the brief warns about.

  // paragraphs *disappears* and a margin replaces it; here the user typed it, it is in the buffer,
  // and it occupies a full 22px line box — so every gap is a whole line plus whatever margin the
  // next block carries. Shrinking the empty line keeps the source honest (the newline is still
  // there, the caret still goes in it) while giving the document the spacing of the thing it is
  // pretending to be.

  // THE CARET'S LINE IS EXEMPT, reversing what this comment used to say.
  //
  // It used to argue that growing the line back as the caret arrives would shift everything below it
  // on an arrow keypress, and that cursor instability is how this approach fails. The first half is
  // true and the second half is what made it the wrong call: the shift happens either way, and
  // leaving it in meant it happened *while typing* instead of while navigating.
  //
  // What that felt like, which is how it was reported: press Return in prose, and the caret lands in
  // a 10px box hard against the line above; type one character, the line becomes an ordinary
  // paragraph, and the text appears 12px BELOW where the caret just was. Every Return in prose, which
  // is the most common thing anyone does in a notes app. A caret that is not where the text lands is
  // exactly the instability the warning was about — it just arrived through the keyboard rather than
  // through the arrow keys.
  //
  // Exempting the caret's line makes typing dead stable: the line is already at its full height when
  // the caret gets there, so the first keystroke moves nothing. The cost moves to leaving a blank
  // line, where a 12px shift reads as the document closing up behind you rather than as the text
  // jumping out from under the caret. It also makes the rule uniform — every line in the document now
  // renders at its natural size under the caret, blank lines included, which is what decisions 42

 * A click on the blank line between two paragraphs does nothing at all.

 * That line is a real `\n` in the file — the paragraph break itself — so the caret can perfectly
 * well stand on it, and for a long time it did. But it is drawn as an 8px strip of empty space, and
 * a strip of empty space between two paragraphs does not read as a place: it reads as the gap
 * between them. Clicking it and getting a caret you did not ask for, in a gap you were only aiming
 * *past*, is the note behaving like a text file rather than like a note. Typora and Obsidian both
 * swallow it.
 *
 * **Only a genuine separator** — an empty line with text immediately above *and* below. That is the
 * case being described and nothing else, which keeps three things working that would otherwise
 * break: a trailing blank line stays clickable, because it is where "click under the last line of
 * the note" lands; a run of blank lines stays clickable, because you may well want to delete one;
 * and a blank line inside a fenced block is content with a background, not a gap.
 *
 * Two more guards. `posAtCoords` is asked for a *precise* hit, so a click in the empty space below
 * the note returns null and falls through to CodeMirror — otherwise a note ending in a blank line
 * would swallow the most ordinary click there is. And an unfocused editor always lets the click
 * through, because swallowing it would leave the pane unfocusable by clicking in the wrong spot.
 *
 * Arrow keys still walk onto the line, and ⌫ still deletes the break (see `joinBackToParagraph`),
 * so nothing about the document has become unreachable — only the aiming has got easier.
