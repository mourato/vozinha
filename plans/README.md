# Implementation Plans

This is the active plan ledger. The next available plan number is 133.

## Execution rules

- Read the complete plan and honor its STOP conditions.
- Keep one objective per execution slice and use `reuse -> extend -> create`.
- Respect dependencies and reclassify risk against the live scope.
- Preserve one writer in an explicitly isolated worktree.
- Run the plan's required lane, review, and validation before marking it done.
- Use atomic Conventional Commits; do not push unless requested.
- Keep product source out of guidance-only plans.

Status values: `TODO` | `IN PROGRESS` | `DONE` | `BLOCKED` | `REJECTED`.

## Dependency order

The Settings reorganization batch is `106 -> 107 -> 108 -> 109`, followed by
runtime vocabulary integration in 110. Plan 111 also depends on 109 and can run
in parallel with 110 only in a separate isolated worktree after confirming that
the shared Dictionary service API is stable. The remediation batch is
`102 -> 103 -> 104 -> 105`. Plan 083 is independent.

Plan 112 is independent of the Settings reorganization batch, but must remain a
single coordinated workstream because it changes shared build, runtime, and
release identity values. It intentionally preserves `com.mourato.prisma`, the
XPC identifier, storage directories, Keychain service, UserDefaults domains,
and `MeetingAssistant*` internal names.

Plan 113 depends on the Release-visible identity from Plan 112. It adds the
interactive Debug/Release runner, installs only Release into the exact
`/Applications/Vozinha.app` target, and must preserve the technical identity
contract from Plan 112. Its AppKit shutdown route and filesystem replacement
transaction are one serial workstream; do not parallelize them.

Plans 114 through 118 are the agent-cost and delivery-automation batch. Plan
114 is guidance-only and should run before routing changes. Plans 115, 116, and
117 are validation infrastructure and should be implemented as separate serial
workstreams. Plan 118 is report-first and must not delete artifacts until its
allowlist and dry-run evidence are accepted. Skill selection otherwise remains
semantic and follows the standard skill descriptions and project guidance.

Plan 121 is a serial architecture migration after the completed dictation
configuration and vocabulary snapshot work in Plans 106 and 110. It owns the
shared transcription request seam across full-file, retry, incremental,
Assistant, provider, and XPC paths; do not parallelize those paths.
Its implementation is reviewed and merged into local `main` through commit
`a5536db9`; it has not been pushed.
Manual validation and the required review are complete. The closeout reran the
gates with Xcode 26.6 (`/Applications/Xcode.app`): Full validation passed, and
`test-sensitive` reproduced the six pre-existing readiness-test failures
already documented in `.agents/reports/phase0-audio-baseline-2026-05-25.md`;
no Plan 121 source or test failure was introduced.

Plan 122 is complete: its lifecycle boundary is merged into local `main` at
`183bee4e`, with stale-callback and reset-order remediation in `61b13e7f`.
Plan 123 is complete: its explicit post-processing request seam is merged
into local `main` at `8a5907e9`; build/test passed all 1,130 tests, with the
known six structural lint baseline violations unchanged. Plan 124 is complete:
execution provenance is persisted through Core Data 1.6, retry and incremental
paths use captured inputs, and the integrated Xcode 26.6 gate passed all 1,138
tests. The only formal gate failure is the unchanged four-violation strict-lint
baseline. Plan 125 is complete: its settings-boundary cleanup is merged into
local `main` at `49d83d6a`, with the remaining singleton reads documented by
semantic allowlist. No separate reminder mechanism is required.

Plan 126 adds proactive calendar reminders (lead notification + full-screen
overlay). It reuses `CalendarEventService` and recording/calendar-note surfaces;
see [ADR 001](../docs/adr/001-meeting-reminder-overlay.md). It is independent of
the completed architecture batch (121–125) and should run as one serial
high-risk workstream.

Plan 127 delivers Pane-inspired meeting notes (hotkey glass panel + CodeMirror
live preview). See [ADR 002](../docs/adr/002-meeting-notes-pane-ux.md). Recommended
order: **126 complete, then 127**. Slice 126-4b (`CalendarEventNotesPanelController`)
merges into Plan 127 slice 2. Plan 127 slice 0–1 can start early only in a
separate worktree with no overlapping panel files.

## Dictation VT parity batch (128–132)

VoiceInk-inspired dictation latency/reliability work (GPL inspiration only; no
source copy). Planned at `08124206` (2026-09-04).

Recommended serial order on shared capture/residency files:

`128 → 130 → 131`, with **129 parallelizable** in a separate worktree, and
**132** after the residency/warmup batch when practical.

| Plan | Intent |
|------|--------|
| 128 | Purpose-aware eager ASR warmup (fix meeting-gated / wrong-model warm) |
| 129 | Hybrid/PTT already exists as `holdOrToggle`; extract, test, clarify UX |
| 130 | Ready-gate so early incremental audio is not transcribed cold |
| 131 | Post-dictation ASR unload grace without weakening meeting residency |
| 132 | Flip `enableDictationIntelligenceMode` and unify kernel gates (no dictation Q&A) |

## Current decisions

- Keep this root ledger active-only; archive completed batches with Git history.
- Keep `AGENTS.md`, the skill descriptions, and the routing guide as the
  sources of truth for agent guidance.
- Keep exact-range technical validation fail closed; reuse only compatible PASS evidence.
- Run high-risk plans as one serial chain: preflight the worktree, toolchain,
  dependencies, and exact test selectors; implement in isolation; validate
  focused behavior; merge; review the integrated diff; remediate; run the full
  gate; then update the ledger.
- Keep `IN PROGRESS` until merge, integrated review, and validation are all
  complete. Record the exact `DEVELOPER_DIR`, commands, results, and any
  stalled reviewer or environment limitation in the plan closeout.
- Store concrete provider/model/language and text-handling values per Dictation
  Mode, then snapshot the effective mode at recording start.
- Keep Dictionary data local-only; preserve Prisma's existing literal and empty
  substitution semantics while adding a separate vocabulary model.
- Use VoiceInk beta as a behavioral benchmark only; do not copy source or adopt
  its CloudKit persistence.
- Dictation VT parity (plans 128–132) reuses existing `holdOrToggle`, residency
  coordinator, and incremental coordinator seams; prefer extend-over-create and
  keep meeting defaults (30m residency, meeting warmup gates) intact unless a
  plan explicitly changes them.
- Prefer deterministic scripts and Make gates for repeatable checks; keep model
  reasoning for ambiguity, design judgment, and user-facing decisions.
- Treat token or time savings as hypotheses until a later measurement pass
  confirms them; these plans intentionally do not require manual usage tables.
- Keep transcription provider/model/language/vocabulary selection explicit at
  the operation edge and route it through the existing adapter/client seam;
  do not reintroduce live settings reads or mutable next-call overrides.

Plan 119 is a guidance-only migration. It must wait until the global macOS
skill bundle is merged and the currently dirty 112–118 work is reconciled. It
preserves vozinha/Prisma specialist skills and moves only the seven shared
macOS skill copies to project overlays.

## Swift 6.2 baseline batch

Plan 120 is the serial compiler, formatter, lint, concurrency, and agent-gate
migration. It must run only after the current worktree is reconciled. It is the
canonical vozinha baseline for sibling-project equalization; source rewrites
are expected but must remain behavior-preserving and diagnostic-driven.
